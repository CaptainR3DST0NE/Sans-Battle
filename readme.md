# Bad Time Simulator (Sans Fight)
This project is a clone of the sans fight from [jcw87](http://https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight/).
I just made it like the actual battle, with the text.

Known Issues
------------
- Heart hitbox is probably not accurate.
- On the sans_platforms4 and sans_platforms4hard attacks, the platform is supposed to accelerate from 0 to its full speed, but I was lazy and started it at full speed immediately. This is only a problem if you try to dodge the bones without jumping.
- Sans dialog is missing. I may add something at some future date, but I have no intention of putting the original text in, as it really only makes sense in the context of the whole game.
- Missing documentation for custom attacks. I intend to add this at some point, but for now, you can reference the *.csv files in the repository. I may change how this works later, so don't be surprised if your custom attack breaks.
